                              The first rule to remember is to never give out any personal information in an email.  No institution, bank or otherwise, will ever ask for this information via email.

It is important to be vigilant at all times and remain suspicious of sources that ask for your credentials and other personal information.

                              Phishing is dangerous for anyone who is even remotely touched by technology because it puts them under the risk of being monitored and exploited. Although significant attacks are carried out on companies, phishing attacks don’t have any particular target list, leaving every technology user exposed to the risk. These attacks typically take advantage of a person’s psychological drawbacks and use them to the benefit of the attackers.

                              Cybersecurity experts recommend users to treat every email they receive as a phishing email so that they are extra careful about all the links and attachments inside the email. At any point in time, when you suspect an email, never reveal your personal information, click any links or open attachments in the email.Make sure to check the accuracy of the e-mail by hovering over the e-mail links to check if the URL is real and original. Compare the email template with an actual email that you have received previously from the trusted source. If you see anything fishy, then it is better to ignore the message or contact the trusted source directly through a phone call or an email to inquire about the issue.
